## Hi, I am Daniel ðŸ‘‹ 

**[TL;DR]**  
convert passion into code

#### About me
Having a customer view on design and usability helps to improve experience in mockup and prototype design with figma. This has a huge impact on the separation into components and workflows as well as datamodels.

**Father**. *Husband*. `Developer`.

Love my family and being a developer. Creating something which nobody uses is the worst thing that can happen.

Implementation in react using typescript a lot easier then...

Ability to not only develop applications but also having the customer view.
